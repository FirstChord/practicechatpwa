## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Test Locally (Simple)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "Desktop/Tools:Games/FC Admin Tools/Practice Chat PWA/public"

# Start a local server (Python)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or use Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Open browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

**Note**: For microphone access, you need HTTPS in production. Local testing works on localhost.

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase

# Initialize Firebase (if first time)
firebase init hosting
# Select: Use existing project
# Choose: practice-chat-pwa (or create new)
# Public directory: public
# Single-page app: Yes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Microphone not working"
- Ensure HTTPS (required for mic access)

- Check browser console for errors

### "Service worker not updating"
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Clear browser cache
- Increment CACHE_NAME in service-worker.js
